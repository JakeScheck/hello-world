# hello-world
First Github Repository

This is my first attempt at a github repository. As I continue to learn more about coding I plan to use this to make it easier to manage revisions, and to transfer new versions of my code between my mac and my raspberry pi which will be the primary device I'm coding for to start.

My first project is a python program which uses pygame to display a static weather dashboard. The first prototype pulls forecasts from weather.com. Eventually I'd like to update it to pull from weather underground, get some pretty icons on there and display a relevant photo in the background.
